# Phase: Visualization and App Development

**Note** that this is not a traditional CRISP-DM phase (the traditional phase in `Modeling`). I have replaced the `Modeling` phase with this phase, which is more appropriate for this project.

## Task: Select Visualization Techniques

### Output: Visualization Techniques

Here you need to list the visualization techniques you have select for the project, and the rationale (i.e. why you have chosen specific visualization techniques for visualizing specific data).

## Task: Generate App Design

### Output: App Design

Here you need to describe the design or your Dash application. Remember, you can use the [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) VSCode Extension to easily create drawings (images) in VSCode that can be included in a markdown file (`.md`) or Jupyter Notebook markdown cell (see `Task: Produce Project Plan` for `Phase: Business Understanding`).

You don't have to create detailed UML digrams, but at least create a simple overview of your architecture and application design.

## Task: Build App

### Output: App Description

Here you need to describe how your Dash application works, so that a user is able to use the application. Remember, it needs to provide interactive visualizations, such that a user can explore and understand the data.

## Task: Assess App

### Output: App Assessment

Assess your Dash application with regards to required functionality. Does you Dash App cover all functional requirements, and are all required visualization included?
