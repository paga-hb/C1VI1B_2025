# Phase: Evaluation

This CRISP-DM phase has been modified somewhat to better align with the currect project.

## Task: Evaluate Results

### Output: Assessment of Data Mining Results

You need to assesses the degree to which the Dash Application and its visualizations meet the business objectives, and determine if there is some business reason why this Dash Application is deficient.

Summarize the assessment results here in terms of business success criteria, including a final statement regarding whether you regard the project as meeting the business objectives or not.

### Output: Approved Visualizations and App Functionality

After assessing the Dash application and its visualizations with respect to the business success criteria, either approve or disapprove the Dash application and its visualizations, given your (the project group's) own judgement.

## Task: Review Process

### Output: Review of Process

Here you need to perform a more thorough review of
the *data mining* engagement in order to determine if there is any important factor or task that has somehow been overlooked, e.g.:
- Did we select and pre-process the datasets appropriately?
- Did we select appropriate visualizations given the underlying data?
- Did we correctly build the Dash application?
- etc.

Summarize the process review and highlight activities that have been missed and those that should really be repeated.

## Task: Determine Next Steps

### Output: List of Possible Actions

Depending on the results of the assessment and the process review, the project team decides how to proceed.

Here we would normally list potential further actions, and rationale (reasons for and against each option), but we will skip this step in this project.

### Output: Decisions

Here we would normally describe the decision as to how to proceed, along with the rationale (e.g. if we need to perform an additional iteration, or proceed to deployment), but we will skip this step in this project, and decide to go ahead with the deployment phase.
