# Phase: Deployment

This CRISP-DM phase has been modified somewhat to better align with the currect project.

## Task: Produce Final Report

### Output: Final Report

Here you need to create a final written report of the data mining engagement, which includes all of the previous deliverables, summarizing and organizing the results. For this project, it might just consist of copy-and-pasting parts that you have documented in the previous phases.

## Task: Produce Final Presentation

### Output: Final Presentation

Here you need to create a final presentation for the seminar, where you will present your project. See the details in the notebook `presentation.ipynb` in the `presentation` folder.

### Output: App Demo

You also need to prepare a demonstration (demo) of your Dash application as part of your final presentation. See the details in the notebook `presentation.ipynb` in the `presentation` folder.

## Task: Review Project

### Output: Experience Documentation

Here you need to assess what went right and what went wrong, what was done well and what needs to be improved.
- Summarize important experience gained during the
project, e.g. pitfalls, misleading approaches, or hints for selecting the best suited datasets, pre-processing techniques, visualizations, and Dash application design.
- Also include a summary of things that have worked well in the CRISP-DM process, and things that haven't worked optimally (including suggestions of improvements if a future second iteration was conducted).
