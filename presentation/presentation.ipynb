    "### Introduction (1–2 min)\n",

    "- **Business Questions**: State the business questions you aimed to answer in the project (e.g., *“What genres perform best across regions?”*, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRISP-DM Process Walkthrough (6–7 min)\n",
    "- **Business Understanding**: What was the real-world motivation or value behind your questions?\n",
    "- **Data Understanding**: What CSV files did you use? What were key variables? Any surprises or issues with the raw data?\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: How did you clean, merge, and transform the datasets with pandas/numpy. (Show a couple of examples: e.g., handling missing values, converting datatypes, filtering outliers, etc.).\n",
    "- **Visualization and App Development**: Discuss choices behind visualization types (why bar chart vs. scatter, why interactive filters matter, etc.).\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: How did your visualizations help answer the business questions. What are the main takeaways?\n",
    "- **<span style=\"color:red;\"><s>Deployment</s></span>** (not included)\n",

    "  - Show filters/dropdowns/interactivity.\n",
    "  - Highlight a couple of key visualizations that directly answer the business questions.\n",
    "  - Show how different user choices affect insights (e.g. how the number of bins in a Histogram affects insights drawn from the visualization, etc.).\n",
    "- **Keep it focused**: demonstrate 2–3 strong features rather than clicking through everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion and Reflection (1–2 min)\n",
    "- **Summarize the key insights** (e.g., *“Sports games dominated in North America, but RPGs performed better in Japan.”*).\n",
    "- **Reflect briefly over the CRISP-DM process**: What worked well? What were the limitations of the data, or you approach?\n",
    "- **Mention possible extensions** (e.g., incorporating temporal trends, more refined dashboards, etc.)."

    "- **Use storytelling**: Frame the business questions as a narrative (*“A publisher wants to know where to launch their next title…”*, etc.).\n",
    "- **Presenter transitions**: Plan who talks about what among your group members, so the presentation flows smoothly.\n",
    "- **Time management**: Aim for a ~1-2 minute introduction, ~6-7 minutes of CRISP-DM explanation, ~5-6 minutes of demo, and a ~1-2 minute wrap-up."
