This is the repository for the Data Visualization (Autumn 2025) course at BorÃ¥s University.

The course schedule can be found on [Kronox](https://schema.hb.se/setup/jsp/Schema.jsp?startDatum=2025-09-01&intervallTyp=a&intervallAntal=1&sprak=SV&sokMedAND=true&forklaringar=true&resurser=k.C1VI1B-20252-I22H5-) and the course material can be found on [Canvas](https://hb.instructure.com/courses/9397).

## Software

Install the following software on your computer:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [.NET Sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (install the latest .net version)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop) (or Docker Engine if on Linux)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure)

## Verify the Software Installation

Verify the software has been successfully installed, by opening a terminal and issuing the following commands (each command should print out a version):

- `code --version`
- `conda --version`
- `git --version`
- `dotnet --version`
- `kubectl version`
- `terraform --version`
- `gh --version`
- `az --version`

If you don't see the print-out of a version for a specific tool, make sure the path to your tool has been added to your `PATH` environment variable.

Also, search for `Docker Desktop` among your installed applications, and start it. Make sure Docker Desktop starts without any issues.

## Accounts

Create a GitHub, Docker and Azure for Students account (if you don't already have one):

- Visit the [GitHub](https://github.com) web site and [Sign up](https://github.com/signup) for an account.
- Visit the [Docker](https://www.docker.com) web site and [Sign up](https://app.docker.com/signup) for an account.
- Visit the [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students) sign up page, click the `Start free` button, and sign up for an account.

## Course Repository

When you have installed the software above, open a terminal and clone the GitHub repository [C3DO1A_2025](https://github.com/paga-hb/C1VI1B_2025) to your computer, and create a Python environment:

- `git clone https://github.com/paga-hb/C3DO1A_2025.git devops`
- `cd devops`
- `conda create -y -p ./.conda python=3.11`
- `conda activate ./.conda`
- `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install ipykernel jupyter`

## Open the First Workshop Notebook

Finally, make sure you are in the `devops` folder in your terminal, and open the first notebook in Visual Studio Code, by issuing the command below:

- `code -g workshop1/environment.ipynb:0 .`

When the notebook opens in VSCode, click the text `Select Kernel` (in the top-right of the notebook), and choose `Python Environments... => conda (Python 3.11) .conda/bin/python`.

Now you can follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the development environment for this course.
